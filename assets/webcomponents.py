    intro='''
    ### Elliott Wave Detection analyzes realtime stock price data based on the [Neely (1990)][1] and purposes to find Elliott Pattern.

    #### The current demo version detects Monowaves of the daily BTC price based on the input index. The Monowave detection follows three rules, rule of proportion, rule of neurality, and rule of observation. The entire codes could be found our Github link and below tutorial documentation. Our future work includes a Elliott Pattern recognition, [Neely methods][1], and realtime analysis based on API.
